# User Management App

## Project Overview
The User Management App is a web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details. It fetches user data from an API and provides a user-friendly interface to manage users, with pagination, error handling, and notifications. The app is responsive, adapting to both mobile and desktop views.

## Features & Functionalities

### User CRUD Operations
- Users can be added, edited, or deleted through a simple and intuitive interface.
- Client-side form validation ensures the correct format of user details before submission.

### Pagination
- Users can navigate through paginated lists of users, improving the user experience when handling large datasets.

### Error Handling
- In case of API failures, appropriate error messages are displayed to keep users informed.

### Responsive Design
- The app is fully responsive, providing different layouts for mobile and desktop views to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

### User Notifications
- Notifications are displayed to inform users when a user is successfully added, updated, or deleted, providing feedback on their actions.

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation ensures that user details are in the correct format before submitting data.

### State Management
- The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and fetch user data from the API, ensuring real-time updates.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **State Management:** React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **API Calls:** Fetch API
- **Styling:** CSS (with a responsive design approach)

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with separate components for different functionalities.

   ```

## Key Components
- **UserList:** Displays a list of users with options to edit or delete.
- **UserForm:** A form to add or edit user details.
- **Pagination:** Handles pagination for navigating between user lists.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:**
   ```bash
      npm install
   ```
2. **Run the app: Start the development server::**
   ```bash
      npm start
   ```
    - The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Challenges Faced
During the development process, I encountered a few challenges:
- **State Management with Pagination:** Managing the users across pages, especially when adding or deleting a user, required careful handling of the state.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensuring that the app looked good on both mobile and desktop required constant adjustments to the CSS and media queries.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling for API requests to provide users with appropriate feedback.

## Improvements (If Given More Time)
- **API Error Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic in case of API failures, rather than just showing an error message.
- **Optimized Pagination:** Improve the pagination logic to allow infinite scrolling or a better user experience with more controls.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Add lazy loading or pagination improvements to handle a large set of users.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for components and API interactions.

## Clean Code Commit History
- **Initial Commit:** Scaffolding for the project, setting up the folder structure, installing dependencies.
- **Add User Management Features:** Added functionality for displaying users, adding, editing, and deleting users.
- **Implement Pagination:** Added pagination functionality to navigate through users.
- **Add Notifications and Error Handling:** Implemented user notifications for CRUD operations and added error handling for API failures.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Refined layout and styling for mobile and desktop views.
- **Final Cleanup:** Removed unnecessary code, added comments, and prepared for deployment.

## Effective Use of Comments

### Commenting During Development
I added comments at key places to explain the logic behind certain decisions, especially in areas that were complex or could be improved later. 

For example, when managing state for pagination, I added comments explaining the need to keep track of users per page separately.

### Example:
   ```
   JS
    // Fetch users for the current page
    const fetchUsers = async (page) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
        // Fetch user data from the API
        const response = await fetch(
        `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?_page=${page}&_limit=5`
        );
        // Parse response and set the users
        const data = await response.json();
        const total = response.headers.get("X-Total-Count");

        const updatedData = data.map((user) => {
        // Split user name into first and last name
        const [firstName, lastName] = user.name.split(" ");
        return {
            ...user,
            firstName,
            lastName,
            department: `Department ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1}`,
        };
        });

        setUsers(updatedData);
        setTotalUsers(total);
        setLoading(false);
    } catch (err) {
        // Handle API error
        setError("Failed to fetch users");
        setLoading(false);
    }
    };
   
   ```

## Conclusion
This project was a great learning experience in building a full-featured React application with state management, pagination, error handling, and responsiveness. If given more time, I would further optimize the app and add more robust testing. The modular folder structure makes it easy to maintain and scale the project.
